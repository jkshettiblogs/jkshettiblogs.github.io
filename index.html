            This is my first blog post. I am using HTML to create a simple blog website. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to structure and format web pages. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. They are represented by tags, such as &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, &lt;h1&gt; for headings, and &lt;div&gt; for divisions. HTML attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements, such as class, id, and style. HTML comments are used to add notes or explanations to the HTML code. They are written inside &lt;!-- and --&gt; symbols.

            This is my second blog post. I am learning more about HTML and how to create a better blog website. HTML is not enough to make a website look attractive and interactive. We need to use other technologies, such as CSS and JavaScript. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to style and layout HTML elements. CSS properties are used to specify the appearance of HTML elements, such as color, font, margin, and border. CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements that we want to style. CSS comments are used to add notes or explanations to the CSS code. They are written inside /* and */ symbols.
